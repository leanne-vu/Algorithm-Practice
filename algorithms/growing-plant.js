// Caring for a plant can be hard work, but since you tend to it regularly, you have a plant that grows consistently.Each day, its height increases by a fixed amount represented by the integer upSpeed.But due to lack of sunlight, the plant decreases in height every night, by an amount represented by downSpeed.

// Since you grew the plant from a seed, it started at height 0 initially.Given an integer desiredHeight, your task is to find how many days it'll take for the plant to reach this height.

// Example

// For upSpeed = 100, downSpeed = 10, and desiredHeight = 910, the output should be
// solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) = 10.
function solution(upSpeed, downSpeed, desiredHeight) {
  var g = upSpeed - downSpeed;
  return Math.max(0, Math.ceil((desiredHeight - upSpeed) / g)) + 1

}

solution()
