// Two arrays are called similar if one can be obtained from another by swapping at most one pair of elements in one of the arrays.

// For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [1, 2, 3], the output should be
// solution(a, b) = true.

// The arrays are equal, no need to swap any elements.

// For a = [1, 2, 3] and b = [2, 1, 3], the output should be
// solution(a, b) = true.

// We can obtain b from a by swapping 2 and 1 in b.

// For a = [1, 2, 2] and b = [2, 1, 1], the output should be
