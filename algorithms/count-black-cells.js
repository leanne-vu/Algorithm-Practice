// Imagine a white rectangular grid of n rows and m columns divided into two parts by a diagonal line running from the upper left to the lower right corner.Now let's paint the grid in two colors according to the following rules:

// A cell is painted black if it has at least one point in common with the diagonal;
// Otherwise, a cell is painted white.
// Count the number of cells painted black.

//   Example

// For n = 3 and m = 4, the output should be
// solution(n, m) = 6.

// There are 6 cells that have at least one common point with the diagonal and therefore are painted black.



// For n = 3 and m = 3, the output should be
// solution(n, m) = 7.

// 7 cells have at least one common point with the diagonal and are painted black.



//   Input / Output

//   [execution time limit]4 seconds(js)

//   [memory limit]1 GB

//   [input] integer n

// The number of rows.

// Guaranteed constraints:
// 1 ≤ n ≤ 105.

// [input] integer m

// The number of columns.

// Guaranteed constraints:
// 1 ≤ m ≤ 105.

// [output] integer

// The number of black cells.
