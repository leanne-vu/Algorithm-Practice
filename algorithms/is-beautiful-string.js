// A string is said to be beautiful if each letter in the string appears at most as many times as the previous letter in the alphabet within the string; ie: b occurs no more times than a; c occurs no more times than b; etc.Note that letter a has no previous letter.

// Given a string, check whether it is beautiful.

//   Example

// For inputString = "bbbaacdafe", the output should be solution(inputString) = true.

// This string contains 3 as, 3 bs, 1 c, 1 d, 1 e, and 1 f(and 0 of every other letter), so since there aren't any letters that appear more frequently than the previous letter, this string qualifies as beautiful.

// For inputString = "aabbb", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

// Since there are more bs than as, this string is not beautiful.

// For inputString = "bbc", the output should be solution(inputString) = false.

// Although there are more bs than cs, this string is not beautiful because there are no as, so therefore there are more bs than as.
//
function solution(inputString) {
  return inputString.split('').sort().join('').replace(/([a-z])\1*/g, (it) => it.length + ',').split(',').slice(0, -1).map(Number).every((el, i, ar) => (inputString.indexOf(String.fromCharCode(i + 'a'.charCodeAt(0))) >= 0 && (i == 0 || ar[i] <= ar[i - 1])))

}
